The project shows a person going on a walk from their house in the city as the day goes on. The classes included are a person class that draws the people in the background and a subclass that draws the main moving person. There is a class called "star" that is a superclass for both the sun and the moon which creates the path they travel along using translate. The sun and the moon class themselves have a glow function which uses scale in order to create a glowing light effect around the shape that travels along it. Some unexpected challenges were getting everything to line up correctly at the end. A lot of our classes used scale and translate which made it hard to sometimes predict where things were going to end up.
